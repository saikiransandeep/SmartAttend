# Smart Attendance Management System - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Selected Approach:** Design System Approach using Material Design principles
**Justification:** This utility-focused application prioritizes efficiency, data clarity, and role-based functionality over visual branding. Material Design provides excellent patterns for data-dense interfaces and complex navigation structures.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- Light Mode: 216 100% 50% (Material Blue)
- Dark Mode: 216 84% 65% (Lighter Blue for accessibility)

**Supporting Colors:**
- Success: 142 76% 36% (Green for present status)
- Warning: 38 92% 50% (Amber for warnings)
- Error: 4 90% 58% (Red for absent status)
- Surface: 220 14% 96% (Light) / 220 13% 18% (Dark)

### B. Typography
**Font Family:** Inter (Google Fonts)
- Headers: 600 weight, sizes 24px-32px

- Captions/labels: 500 weight, 14px
- Data tables: 400 weight, 14px for density

### C. Layout System
**Spacing Units:** Tailwind units 2, 4, 6, and 8
- Tight spacing: p-2, m-2 for compact data views
- Standard spacing: p-4, m-4 for general layouts  
- Generous spacing: p-6, m-6 for section breaks
- Large spacing: p-8, m-8 for page-level separation

### D. Component Library

**Navigation:**

- Collapsible sections for department/subject hierarchies
- Breadcrumb navigation for deep page structures

**Data Display:**
- Clean data tables with sorting and filtering
- Progress bars for attendance percentages
- Status badges (Present/Absent) with appropriate colors

## Role-Based Design Considerations

**Faculty Dashboard:** Focus on quick attendance entry with large, touch-friendly buttons for mobile use
**Student Dashboard:** Emphasis on personal attendance visualization with clear progress indicators
**Administrative Dashboards:** Data-dense layouts with comprehensive filtering and export capabilities

## Mobile Optimization
